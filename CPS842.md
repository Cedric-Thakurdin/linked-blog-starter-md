### Lecture 1
- What is Information Retrieval?
	-  Finding material of unstructured nature which satisfies information need from large collections
	- Representation and organization of items should provide users with easy access to information of interest 
- The IR Problem
	- The IR Process Flow
		- User submits Query
		- Query goes through text processing ,representation, and transformation
		- System performs matchmaking between query terms and index terms to produce ranked relevant documents
	- Key Goal of an IR system:
		- retrieve all items relevant to user query
		- while retrieving as few non-relevant items as possible

### Lecture 2
- Basic IR Terminology
	- Index term: word or group of consecutive words in document
	- Document: represented by set of representative index terms
	- Collection or corpus: group of documents we perform retrieval on
	- Vocabulary: sset of all distinct index terms in collection
		- Free text vs controlled vocabulary
			- Free text 
				- uses exact words that appear in documents
				- any word can be index term
			- Controlled vocabulary
				- uses predetermined, limited set of approved terms for indexing
				- Consistency: all docs about same topic indexed with same standard terms
	- Query: Set of index terms transformed from user's information need

	- Matchmaking
		- represents how to effectivley match query terms with index terms to find relevant docs
- IR Modeling 
	- A complex process
	- Ranking FUnction
		- Ranking function: functions that assigns scores to documents, which reflects relevance to given query
		- What is relevance?
		- certain vaugeness / uncertainty in user query
- IR Model Representation
