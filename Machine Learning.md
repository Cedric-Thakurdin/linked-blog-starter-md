### Supervised Learning
- Terminology
	- Dataset: collection of data objects
	- Object : Instance, Record, Point 
	- Attribute (Variable) : Property or characteristic of object
	- Target concept: Function to be learned
	- Training set: Set of instances to predict target concept
	- Test set: Instances used to evaluate model (candidate concept)
	- Candidate: Concept that could model target concept
- Classification
	- assigning objects to a class
- Regression:
	- assigning objects to continuous values
- Hunts Algorithm
	- Split when node is not pure
	- If no more attributes AND node not pure use label in majority
		- If label is equal, flip of coin to decide
- How should training instances be split
	- Multi-way split
		- as many partitions as distinct values
	- Binary Split:
		- Divides values into two subsets
		- Must preserver order
- Entropy
- Midterm Trick
	- How do you split the data
		- Find the information gain of each split
